# Desktop Embedding for Flutter

This repository contains code that implements basic embedders for
[Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) on desktop platforms, as starting
points for building native desktop applications that embed Flutter. It does not
contain the Flutter engine itself, as that is part of the Flutter project, only
implementation of Flutter's embedding API (e.g., passing mouse and keyboard
events to Flutter).

Currently only macOS is supported, but the goal is to support other desktop
embedders in the future.

## How to use this code

See the README file in the directory corresponding to your platform.
